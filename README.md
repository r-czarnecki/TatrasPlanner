# Databases

This project was created as part of the University of Warsaw's Databases course.

The goal of the project was to design and implement a web application, that allows users to find the best routes between two points of Tatra mountains. After selecting those two points, a user is presented with a list of possible routes. Each of them can be inspected, to reveal its details, such as the intermediate points, the color of the route, estimated travel time, distance and height above the sea level of each place.

The project uses Oracle SQL Database to store the necessary data and to find the routes.
